{"Major": "Artificial Intelligence", "Term": "algorithmic probability", "Explanation": "Algorithmic probability (Solomonoff probability) is the probability that a random program on a fixed universal computer outputs a given string. It embodies Occam’s razor: shorter (simpler) programs are more probable. It is incomputable in general, but serves as a theoretical prior in AI."}
{"Major": "Artificial Intelligence", "Term": "attributional calculus", "Explanation": "Attributional calculus is a formal framework for assigning credit to the causes (inputs, rules, or components) of an AI decision, to explain why a model produced a certain output. In practice, it underpins feature attribution methods (e.g., SHAP, LIME) that score each input's contribution to a prediction."}
