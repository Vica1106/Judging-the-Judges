{"Major": "Artificial Intelligence", "Term": "algorithmic probability", "Explanation": "Algorithmic probability: the chance that a random program on a universal computer outputs a given string; used as a formal prior for inductive inference (Solomonoff induction), favoring shorter (simpler) programs."}
{"Major": "Artificial Intelligence", "Term": "attributional calculus", "Explanation": "Attributional calculus (not a widely standard term) would be a formal method for attributing a model’s output to its input attributes—i.e., a feature-attribution framework that calculates how much each input feature contributed to the final decision to explain AI results. Example: explaining why a loan was approved by showing each feature’s contribution. If you meant a different concept, tell me."}
{"Major": "Artificial Intelligence", "Term": "statistical relational learning (SRL)", "Explanation": "Statistical Relational Learning (SRL) = techniques that model uncertainty in structured, relational data by combining probabilistic reasoning with representations of entities and their relationships (e.g., MLNs, PRMs)."}
{"Major": "Artificial Intelligence", "Term": "metabolic network reconstruction and simulation", "Explanation": "Metabolic network reconstruction and simulation: building a computational model of an organism’s metabolism (metabolites, reactions, regulation) and using simulations to predict fluxes, growth, and responses to perturbations."}
{"Major": "Artificial Intelligence", "Term": "dynamic epistemic logic (DEL)", "Explanation": "Dynamic Epistemic Logic (DEL) is a formal framework for modeling how agents' knowledge and beliefs change when events occur or information is revealed, by combining epistemic logic with dynamic updates (e.g., public or private announcements) via event/action models. Example: a public announcement of p makes p known to all agents."}
{"Major": "Artificial Intelligence", "Term": "neural Turing machine (NTM)", "Explanation": "Neural Turing Machine (NTM): a neural network with differentiable external memory and read/write heads, controlled by a neural controller, enabling end-to-end learning of algorithmic tasks via gradient descent."}
{"Major": "Artificial Intelligence", "Term": "answer set programming (ASP)", "Explanation": "Answer Set Programming (ASP) is a declarative AI approach: encode a problem as logical rules, and use an ASP solver to compute answer sets (stable models) that represent valid solutions, enabling nonmonotonic reasoning for hard combinatorial problems."}
{"Major": "Artificial Intelligence", "Term": "NP-completeness", "Explanation": "NP-complete: problems that are in NP (solutions verifiable quickly) and are as hard as any NP problem—every NP problem can be reduced to an NP-complete problem in polynomial time. So solving one NP-complete problem quickly would allow solving all NP problems (and if any NP-complete problem is solved in poly time, P=NP). Example: SAT."}
{"Major": "Artificial Intelligence", "Term": "partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP)", "Explanation": "Partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) is a framework for sequential decision making under partial observability: the agent can’t see the true state, receives noisy observations, maintains a belief (probability distribution over states), and chooses actions to maximize expected cumulative reward."}
{"Major": "Artificial Intelligence", "Term": "quantum computing", "Explanation": "Quantum computing: a form of computing that uses qubits and quantum phenomena (superposition, entanglement) to perform certain tasks much faster than classical computers. It could speed up AI tasks (training, optimization, inference), but is still experimental and hardware-limited today."}
