It has some interdisciplinary relevance in robotics, cognitive science, and agent-based modeling, though overall familiarity remains moderate among general college students."}
{"Major": "Computer Science", "Term": "agent-based model (ABM)", "Specialization": 7, "Complexity": 7, "Familiarity": 5, "Explainability": 3, "Interdisciplinary_Reach": 9, "Cognitive_Load": 7, "Overall Assessment": "ABMs sit at the intersection of CS and many other fields; they're not everyday terms but are widely taught in modeling and simulations courses. The concept is approachable with a clear definition, yet understanding emergence, stochasticity, and multi-agent interactions requires some programming and abstract reasoning. Overall, moderately difficult for non-majors but increasingly common across disciplines."}
