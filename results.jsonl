{"Major": "Physics", "Term": "ab initio", "Specialization": 6, "Complexity": 8, "Familiarity": 4, "Explainability": 4, "Interdisciplinary_Reach": 9, "Cognitive_Load": 8, "Overall Assessment": "Ab initio methods are a first-principles approach used across several disciplines (not unique to physics). For a non-major student, the term signals a fairly advanced concept—the idea of solving many-body quantum systems from basic interactions—which carries high cognitive load and complexity. It’s somewhat familiar to science students but not everyday knowledge. It can be explained simply as 'calculations from first principles,' but fully grasping the details requires background in quantum mechanics and computational methods."}
{"Major": "Physics", "Term": "Abbe number", "Specialization": 9, "Complexity": 6, "Familiarity": 3, "Explainability": 3, "Interdisciplinary_Reach": 5, "Cognitive_Load": 5, "Overall Assessment": "Moderate difficulty for a non-major student. The Abbe number is a specialized optics concept describing material dispersion; it can be explained succinctly, but grasping its significance typically requires some background in refractive index and wavelength dependence, making it reasonably approachable in short terms but not widely familiar outside optics-related fields."}
{"Major": "Physics", "Term": "absolute electrode potential", "Specialization": 9, "Complexity": 8, "Familiarity": 8, "Explainability": 7, "Interdisciplinary_Reach": 6, "Cognitive_Load": 8, "Overall Assessment": "Highly specialized and conceptually demanding; non-majors would likely struggle to grasp it quickly without background in electrochemistry and energy-level references."}
{"Major": "Physics", "Term": "absolute humidity", "Specialization": 6, "Complexity": 3, "Familiarity": 5, "Explainability": 2, "Interdisciplinary_Reach": 7, "Cognitive_Load": 3, "Overall Assessment": "Moderately easy for a non-major to grasp quickly; while 'humidity' is common, 'absolute humidity' is a more specialized measure. It has cross-disciplinary relevance (meteorology, HVAC, environmental science) and can be defined succinctly as the mass of water vapor per unit volume of air."}
{"Major": "Physics", "Term": "absolute pressure", "Specialization": 7, "Complexity": 3, "Familiarity": 4, "Explainability": 2, "Interdisciplinary_Reach": 7, "Cognitive_Load": 3, "Overall Assessment": "Relatively straightforward to grasp for non-majors with basic lab exposure; moderately specialized term best understood with context, but not extremely abstract."}
