{"Major": "Statistics", "Term": "statistical inference", "Complexity": 7, "Familiarity": 6, "Explainability": 6, "Overall Assessment": "Core concept in statistics; approachable with concrete examples, but can be abstract without practice.", "Average_Score": 6.33}
{"Major": "Statistics", "Term": "joint distribution", "Complexity": 6, "Familiarity": 6, "Explainability": 5, "Overall Assessment": "Foundational concept in probability; approachable with concrete examples but can be abstract when X and Y are continuous or dependent.", "Average_Score": 5.67}
{"Major": "Statistics", "Term": "random variable", "Complexity": 6, "Familiarity": 7, "Explainability": 4, "Overall Assessment": "Fundamental concept; intuitive explanation is accessible, but the formal definition (a measurable function on a probability space) adds abstraction that can challenge beginners.", "Average_Score": 5.67}
{"Major": "Statistics", "Term": "confidence interval (CI)", "Complexity": 7, "Familiarity": 4, "Explainability": 5, "Overall Assessment": "A core inferential statistics concept that links sample data to a range likely to contain the population parameter; understandable with examples but the frequentist interpretation and nuance can be counterintuitive for non-majors.", "Average_Score": 5.33}
{"Major": "Statistics", "Term": "covariance", "Complexity": 6, "Familiarity": 5, "Explainability": 5, "Overall Assessment": "A foundational measure of joint variability; intuitive with the idea of co-movement, but requires some algebra to compute and interpret precisely.", "Average_Score": 5.33}
{"Major": "Statistics", "Term": "likelihood function", "Complexity": 6, "Familiarity": 4, "Explainability": 6, "Overall Assessment": "Conceptually central in statistics; understandable with a concrete example, but distinguishing it from a probability distribution and interpreting the conditional framing can be challenging for beginners.", "Average_Score": 5.33}
{"Major": "Statistics", "Term": "probability measure", "Complexity": 6, "Familiarity": 5, "Explainability": 5, "Overall Assessment": "Foundational probabilistic concept; easy to convey at a high level, but formal details involve measure theory.", "Average_Score": 5.33}
