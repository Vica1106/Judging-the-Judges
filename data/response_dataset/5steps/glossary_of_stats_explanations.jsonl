{"Major": "Statistics", "Term": "mutual independence", "Explanation": "1. One-sentence definition: Mutual independence of a collection of events means that for every nonempty finite subset S, P(∩_{A∈S} A) = ∏_{A∈S} P(A).\n\n2. Simple intuition based on the definition: If events are mutually independent, knowing that some occur does not change the probability of any others; the joint probability is the product of their individual probabilities (e.g., three fair coin flips: P(HHH) = 1/8).\n\n3. Key components of the topic and related concepts: The product rule must hold for all finite subsets; this implies the joint distribution factors into the product of marginals and is stronger than mere pairwise independence—every subset must satisfy the rule, not just pairs.\n\n4. Clear real-world analogy: Three independent light switches, each ON with probability p. The chance all three are ON is p^3, and the chance any subset is ON is the product of their individual probabilities; this mirrors mutual independence.\n\n5. Common misconception or confusion: Pairwise independence does not imply mutual independence; mutual independence requires the product rule for every subset, including triples, not just pairs."}
{"Major": "Statistics", "Term": "statistical inference", "Explanation": "1. One-sentence definition\nStatistical inference is the process of using data from a sample to estimate or test ideas about a population parameter.\n\n2.

Key components of the topic and related concepts\n- Population, sample\n- Unknown parameter vs. sample statistic\n- Sampling distribution\n- Estimation (confidence intervals)\n- Hypothesis testing (p-values)\n- Uncertainty\n\n4.

Common misconception or confusion\n- Inference does not prove the population; it estimates parameters with uncertainty.\n- A p-value is not the probability the hypothesis is true.\n- Correlation ≠ causation; sample bias can distort generalizations."}
{"Major": "Statistics", "Term": "joint distribution", "Explanation": "1.**One-sentence definition**: The joint distribution of two random variables X and Y describes the probabilities of all possible pairs (X=x, Y=y) in the discrete case, or the joint density f(x,y) in the continuous case, showing how X and Y occur together.\n\n2.**Simple intuition based on the definition**: It’s a map of how two attributes co-occur, telling which combinations are common or rare, not just what each variable does on its own.\n\n3.**Key components of the topic and related concepts**: Variables X,Y; joint probability function P(X=x,Y=y) or joint density f(x,y); marginals P(X=x), P(Y=y) or f_X(x), f_Y(y); conditional distributions P(Y|X), f_{Y|X}; independence if P(X,Y)=P(X)P(Y).\n\n4.**Clear real-world analogy**: Analogy: a vending-machine chart. Rows are X (drink type), columns are Y (size). Each cell shows P(X=x, Y=y); the grid is the joint distribution. Marginals come from summing a row (P(X=x)) or a column (P(Y=y)). Independence means a cell equals the product of its row total and column total. Conditional corresponds to focusing on a row given X or a column given Y.\n\n5.**Common misconception or confusion**: People often think the joint distribution is just the product of two marginals regardless; it only factorizes as a product when X and Y are independent; otherwise the joint carries dependence information."}
{"Major": "Statistics", "Term": "random variable", "Explanation": "1. One-sentence definition\nA random variable is a function that assigns a numerical value to each outcome of a random experiment.\n\n2. Simple intuition based on the definition\nIt’s the rule that turns what happens into a number we can analyze (e.g., from a die roll, the outcome is 1–6, and the variable assigns that number or some summary of outcomes).\n\n3. Key components of the topic and related concepts\n- Sample space: all possible outcomes\n- The mapping: the random variable itself\n- Distribution: probabilities of its values (pmf for discrete, pdf for continuous)\n- Moments: mean, variance\n- Types: discrete vs continuous\n\n4. Clear real-world analogy\nAnalogy: draw a hand from a deck and let the random variable be the number of red cards in the hand. Outcomes are specific card hands; the variable assigns a count to each hand (0,1,2,…); the distribution gives the chances of each count; a single draw yields a realized count.\n\n5. Common misconception or confusion\nA random variable is not the probability or the outcome itself; it’s the function mapping outcomes to numbers. A single trial gives a realized value, while the distribution describes many possible values and their likelihoods."}
{"Major": "Statistics", "Term": "confidence interval (CI)", "Explanation": "1) One-sentence definition:\nA confidence interval is a range derived from sample data that, in repeated sampling, would contain the true population parameter a specified proportion (the confidence level, e.g., 95%).\n\n2) Simple intuition based on the definition:\nBecause sample data vary, a single study yields an interval that reflects uncertainty. If we repeated the study many times, about 95% of the constructed intervals would capture the true value.\n\n3) Key components of the topic and related concepts:\n- Population parameter (the true value) and a sample statistic (e.g., sample mean or proportion)\n- Margin of error and standard error\n- Confidence level (e.g., 95%) and sampling variability\n- Assumptions (random/representative sample, independence, distribution)\n- Related ideas: standard error, margin of error, p-values, Bayesian credible interval\n\n4) Clear real-world analogy:\nImagine the true value as a hidden bullseye. Each study is a dart throw that gives a center (the point estimate) and a surrounding radius (the interval). If you threw many times, about 95% of those radii would include the bullseye. Here: bullseye = true parameter; center = estimate; radius = margin of error; 95% = confidence level.\n\n5) Common misconception or confusion:\nOften people say the parameter “has a 95% probability” of lying in this specific interval. In fact, the parameter is fixed; the interval is random. The 95% refers to long-run coverage across repeated samples, not this single interval."}
{"Major": "Statistics", "Term": "covariance", "Explanation": "1. One-sentence definition: Covariance between X and Y is Cov(X,Y) = E[(X−μX)(Y−μY)].\n\n2. Simple intuition based on the definition: If X and Y tend to be above (or below) their means together, Cov > 0; if one tends to be high when the other is low, Cov < 0. A larger magnitude means a stronger joint movement, but it depends on the units of X and Y.\n\n3. Key components of the topic and related concepts: X and Y; their means μX, μY; deviations (X−μX), (Y−μY); the expectation; population vs. sample covariance (e.g., sXY = 1/(n−1) Σ (xi−x̄)(yi−ȳ)); and its relation to correlation r = Cov/(σX σY).\n\n4. Clear real-world analogy: Two dancers on a stage. Their steps are deviations from their usual positions. If they step in the same direction at the same time, covariance is positive; if they move in opposite directions, covariance is negative. The average product of their deviations over time reflects how much they “move together,” matching the technical idea of Cov.\n\n5. Common misconception or confusion: Covariance is not correlation; zero covariance does not imply independence (except in special cases like joint normal distributions). Covariance depends on units, so use correlation to compare different pairs."}
{"Major": "Statistics", "Term": "likelihood function", "Explanation": "1. One-sentence definition\nThe likelihood function L(θ) is the probability (or density) of the observed data viewed as a function of the parameter θ, with the data fixed.\n\n2. Simple intuition based on the definition\nIt answers: if θ were the true parameter, how likely would I have observed my data? It ranks parameter values by how well they explain the data.\n\n3. Key components of the topic and related concepts\nData x; parameter θ; statistical model P(X|θ) or f_X(x|θ); L(θ) = P(X=x|θ) (discrete) or f_X(x|θ) (continuous); the θ that maximizes L(θ) is the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE); note L is not a probability distribution over θ.\n\n4. Clear real-world analogy\nAnalogy: testing recipes. θ represents a recipe, x is the cake you actually baked. The likelihood L(θ) measures how likely that cake would result from that recipe. The best recipe is the one with the highest likelihood; every other θ is ranked by that fit.\n\n5. Common misconception or confusion\nMistakenly equating likelihood with P(θ|x) or with P(θ). Likelihood is a function of θ (not a probability over θ); it helps one estimate θ, not directly assign probabilities to θ. Bayesian methods convert it to P(θ|x) with priors."}
{"Major": "Statistics", "Term": "probability measure", "Explanation": "1) One-sentence definition\nA probability measure is a function P that assigns to every event (a set of outcomes) a number in [0,1], with P(sample space)=1, P(empty)=0, and it is countably additive.\n\n2) Simple intuition based on the definition\nIt quantifies how likely events are: probabilities of disjoint events add up, and the total probability across all possibilities is 1.\n\n3) Key components of the topic and related concepts\nSample space (all outcomes), events (subsets of outcomes), sigma-algebra (the collection of events P acts on), P: events → [0,1], and properties (nonnegativity, normalization, countable additivity). Related ideas: random variables, probability distributions, and the cumulative distribution function (CDF).\n\n4) Clear real-world analogy\nImagine a bag with colored balls. P(color) is the chance of drawing that color. The events “draw red,” “draw blue,” etc., are disjoint, and the sum of all color probabilities is 1. Technically, colors ↔ events and counts/weights ↔ probabilities.\n\n5) Common misconception or confusion\nP(A) is not the observed frequency in a single trial; it is a theoretical assignment that often matches long-run frequencies under repeated trials, not a statement about a single outcome."}
{"Major": "Statistics", "Term": "regression analysis", "Explanation": "1. One-sentence definition: Regression analysis is a statistical method for modeling the relationship between a dependent variable Y and one or more independent variables X to predict Y.\n\n2.

Key components of the topic and related concepts:\n- Y (dependent), X (independent) or Xs\n- Model form (linear vs nonlinear) and coefficients (slope, intercept)\n- Estimation method (e.g., least squares)\n- Residuals (prediction errors) and evaluation (R-squared, RMSE)\n- Assumptions (linearity, independence, homoscedasticity, normal residuals)\n- Related ideas: correlation vs regression, overfitting, multicollinearity\n\n4. Clear real-world analogy:\n- Analogy: Predicting a student’s test score from study hours.\n- Mapping: X = study hours; Y = score; best-fit line = predicted score; slope = extra score per hour; intercept = expected score with zero study; residuals = actual minus predicted scores; R-squared = variance in scores explained by study hours; assumptions = linear relation and other standard model requirements.\n\n5. Common misconception or confusion: Regression shows association, not causation. It can be misleading if confounders exist or if you extrapolate beyond the data."}
{"Major": "Statistics", "Term": "causal study", "Explanation": "1) One-sentence definition:\nA causal study is research aimed at showing that a cause or treatment directly changes an outcome, ideally by random assignment to isolate effects.\n\n2) Simple intuition based on the definition:\nIf you randomly assign some people to receive a treatment and compare them to similar people who don’t, any difference in outcome is likely due to the treatment, not other factors.\n\n3) Key components of the topic and related concepts:\n- Treatment (the cause) and outcome (the effect)\n- Comparison group (control)\n- Randomization (in experiments) or methods to adjust for confounding (in observational studies)\n- Counterfactual thinking and assumptions (e.g., no unmeasured confounding, stable unit treatment value)\n\n4) Clear real-world analogy:\nTaste-testing two recipes for a dish: randomly assign diners to Recipe A or Recipe B and compare ratings. Random assignment balances other factors (diners’ tastes, hunger) so rating differences reflect the recipe difference (causal effect) rather than background factors. Mapping: treatment = recipe A vs B, outcome = rating, randomization = equalizing groups, control = the non-received recipe, counterfactual = “would have rated the other recipe instead?”\n\n5) Common misconception or confusion:\nConfusing correlation with causation. Observing an association does not prove that one thing caused the other; confounding or reverse causation can create a misleading link without a proper causal design."}
