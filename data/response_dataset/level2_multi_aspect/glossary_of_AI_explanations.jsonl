{"Major": "Artificial Intelligence", "Term": "Selective Linear Definite Clause Resolution", "Explanation": "Selective Linear Definite Clause Resolution (SLD resolution) is a method AI uses to answer questions from a set of rules.\n\n- Basic meaning: It is a rule-based reasoning process. A definite clause is a rule like Head :- Body1, Body2, ..., Bodyn. Linear means we prove the goal step by step in a single chain. Selective means we choose one subgoal at a time (usually the leftmost one) to resolve. If a path fails, the system backtracks to try alternatives.\n\n- Simple real-world example: Rule: eat(X) if hungry(X) and lunchtime. Facts: hungry(alice). lunchtime. Query: eat(alice). Resolve leftmost subgoals: hungry(alice) is true, lunchtime is true, so eat(alice) is proven. If hungry(alice) were false, the system could backtrack to try other rules or conclude it can’t prove eat(alice).\n\n- Why it matters: It’s the core inference mechanism behind logic programming (e.g., Prolog). It lets computers reason with rules, build knowledge bases, and automatically derive answers or explanations, using systematic search and backtracking."}
{"Major": "Artificial Intelligence", "Term": "Big O notation", "Explanation": "Big O notation (for a non-expert)\n\n- Basic meaning: It’s a way to describe how the time or memory an algorithm uses grows as the input size (n) grows. It focuses on the worst case and ignores tiny constants and less important factors, showing the general trend.\n\n- Simple real-world example: If you check each item on a shelf to find one you want, you might look at all n items. That’s O(n) time—double the items, double the work. If you sort first (costing roughly O(n log n)) and then use a fast search (O(log n)), the search part grows much more slowly with n.\n\n- Why it’s important: It helps you compare different approaches and predict how performance will scale as data gets bigger. This matters for AI too—training time, memory use, and inference speed depend on dataset size, model size, and algorithm choices. Big O helps you choose solutions that stay practical as problems grow."}
{"Major": "Artificial Intelligence", "Term": "neural machine translation (NMT)", "Explanation": "Meaning: NMT (neural machine translation) is a type of artificial intelligence that translates text from one language to another using neural networks. It learns from lots of example translations and aims to produce fluent, accurate sentences in the target language, using context rather than word-by-word rules.\n\nReal-world example: In a chat app, typing “I would like a coffee” can yield “Me gustaría un café” in Spanish. A travel website can automatically translate product pages into your language, so you can compare options without leaving the site.\n\nWhy it’s important: It helps people understand information and communicate across languages, enabling global business, education, travel, and media access. It saves time and scales to many languages. It’s powerful, but not perfect and depends on good data and privacy considerations."}
{"Major": "Artificial Intelligence", "Term": "NP-hardness", "Explanation": "- Basic meaning: NP-hard means a problem is at least as hard as the hardest problems in NP. If you could solve an NP-hard problem quickly (in polynomial time), you could solve all NP problems quickly. It’s a label for problems with no known fast, general solution.\n\n- Simple real-world example: The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) for finding the cheapest route that visits many cities and returns to the start. As the number of cities grows, the possible routes grow explodingly, and no fast method is known to always pick the best one. The optimization version is NP-hard.\n\n- Why it’s important: It explains why many practical AI tasks (routing, scheduling, resource allocation) are inherently difficult. Knowing a problem is NP-hard helps us use approaches like heuristics, approximations, or special cases, rather than hoping for guaranteed fast exact solutions in all situations. It also guides research toward practical algorithms and performance trade-offs."}
{"Major": "Artificial Intelligence", "Term": "true quantified Boolean formula", "Explanation": "True quantified Boolean formula (true QBF) is a logical statement built from true/false variables, using logical connectives and quantifiers like: for all (∀) and there exists (∃). A formula is “true” if it evaluates to true under the usual rules when those quantifiers are applied to the variables.\n\nSimple real-world example:\n- Formula: ∀x ∃y (x ∨ y)\n- Interpretation: For every x (think of a request being present or not), there exists a y (a matching response) so that x ∨ y is true. If x=0, pick y=1; if x=1, the expression is true regardless of y. So the whole statement is true.\n\nWhy it’s important:\n- It generalizes SAT and lets us reason about scenarios with alternating choices (one party versus another).\n- Used in AI planning, formal verification, and proving properties of systems and protocols where outcomes depend on multiple, interacting decisions.\n- It’s computationally hard, but it provides a powerful way to model robust guarantees across all possible situations."}
{"Major": "Artificial Intelligence", "Term": "algorithmic probability", "Explanation": "Algorithmic probability (a concept from AI theory)\n\n- Basic meaning: It’s a way to judge how likely a data sequence is if it came from a computer program. We look at all possible programs that could produce the data on a universal computer, and give more weight to shorter (simpler) programs. So simpler explanations are considered more probable.\n\n- Simple real-world example: If you see the notes “C-D-E, C-D-E, …” repeated, the easiest explanation is a short loop that prints C-D-E over and over. A totally random sequence would require a long, messy program. So algorithmic probability would favor continuing the repeating pattern.\n\n- Why it’s important: It formalizes the idea that simple explanations are often best (Occam’s razor) and helps explain why we expect patterns to generalize. It underpins principles of learning, data compression, and model selection in AI. In practice the exact measure is not computable, but it guides practical methods (like MDL and Bayesian priors) to favor simpler, more predictive models."}
{"Major": "Artificial Intelligence", "Term": "behavior informatics (BI)", "Explanation": "- Basic meaning: Behavior informatics (BI) is the study and use of data about people's actions to understand, predict, and influence behavior. It combines data science with psychology and information science to turn digital traces (clicks, sensor data, searches, posts) into insights, models, and practical actions.\n\n- Simple real-world example: An online retailer uses BI to track how visitors move on a site, what they click, how long they stay, and whether they buy. BI finds many abandon at checkout and suggests changes (simplified checkout, reminders, personalized discounts) to boost sales.\n\n- Why it’s important: BI helps design better products, tailor experiences, and support decisions in health, safety, and business by turning behavior data into actionable knowledge. It also raises privacy and ethics considerations—need for consent, data minimization, and transparent use."}
{"Major": "Artificial Intelligence", "Term": "big data", "Explanation": "- Basic meaning: Big data refers to extremely large and fast-growing collections of information from many sources that are hard to store, manage, or analyze with traditional software. It often involves volume, velocity (speed), and variety (many kinds of data), and sometimes veracity and value.\n\n- Simple real-world example: A streaming video service tracks what you watch, when you watch, what device you use, your search queries, and your ratings from millions of users every day. This huge mix of data allows personalized recommendations and smarter content suggestions.\n\n- Why it is important: Analyzing big data helps businesses improve products, services, and operations, and it powers AI by training models on vast examples. It enables better decisions, forecasts demand, detects patterns, and tailors experiences. It also raises privacy and security challenges and needs new tools."}
{"Major": "Artificial Intelligence", "Term": "convolutional neural network", "Explanation": "- Basic meaning: A convolutional neural network (CNN) is a type of artificial neural network designed for images. It uses small filters that slide over the image to detect simple patterns (like edges). These features are combined through multiple layers to recognize more complex shapes. The same filters are reused across the image, and pooling helps reduce size and keep important information.\n\n- Simple real-world example: Imagine sorting photos into cats and dogs. A CNN learns to spot features (fur, ears, shapes) to decide which category each photo belongs to, even if the exact position or size of the subject varies.\n\n- Why it’s important: CNNs automate visual tasks with high accuracy, enabling apps like photo organization, facial recognition, medical imaging analysis, and self-driving cars. They learn useful features directly from data, reducing the need for manual feature engineering."}
{"Major": "Artificial Intelligence", "Term": "Darkforest", "Explanation": "Darkforest (Dark Forest) concept for a non-expert\n\n- Basic meaning: A metaphor from Liu Cixin’s fiction. The universe is like a dark forest where every civilization is a hunter. If you reveal yourself (signal your existence or power), others might attack to ensure their own safety. So civilizations stay hidden or strike first, to avoid being destroyed.\n\n- Simple real-world example: In AI and cybersecurity, companies or countries may withhold details about powerful AI systems or vulnerabilities. Revealing capabilities could invite misuse or harassment by competitors or attackers. For instance, two rival labs might avoid publicly announcing a breakthrough to prevent an arms-race or exploitation by others.\n\n- Why it’s important: It helps explain why openness and signaling can be risky in high-stakes tech. It shapes debates about safety, governance, and international norms for AI: when to share, how to secure, and how to cooperate—balancing progress with the danger of revealing too much. It highlights why prudent secrecy and strong safety measures matter in multi-agent AI ecosystems."}
