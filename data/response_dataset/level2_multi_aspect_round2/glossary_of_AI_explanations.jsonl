{"Major": "Artificial Intelligence", "Term": "Selective Linear Definite Clause Resolution", "Explanation": "- Basic idea (one sentence): SLD resolution is a logic-based method for answering questions by applying rules to a goal one step at a time, turning it into simpler subgoals until an answer is proven or not.\n\n- Real-world example (1–2 sentences): Analogy: solving a mystery by following clues. You pick a clue (the goal), use rules to infer the next clue, and repeat, each step reducing the problem until you can confirm the solution.\n\n- Why it matters (takeaway): It keeps AI reasoning organized and efficient by avoiding a wild, all-at-once search, and it’s a core technique behind systems like Prolog that derive answers from facts and rules."}
{"Major": "Artificial Intelligence", "Term": "Big O notation", "Explanation": "- Basic idea: Big O notation is a simple way to describe how the time (or space) an algorithm needs grows as the amount of data increases.\n- Real-world example: Looking up a name in a long list by checking each entry one by one gets noticeably slower as the list gets bigger; if the list is well organized and you can jump to the right spot, the search grows much more slowly.\n- Why it matters: It helps you predict performance and choose faster algorithms as data gets larger. Quick takeaway: aim for methods whose growth rate stays small even as data grows."}
{"Major": "Artificial Intelligence", "Term": "neural machine translation (NMT)", "Explanation": "- Basic idea (with a simple analogy): NMT is like a student who reads thousands of bilingual books; it learns to translate text from one language to another by spotting patterns in those examples.\n- Real-world example: It can translate \"How are you?\" into natural Spanish \"¿Cómo estás?\" or French \"Comment ça va?\" based on what it learned from many examples. Because it uses patterns it saw in millions of sentences, the result tends to read more naturally than simple word substitution.\n- Why it matters (takeaway): Takeaway: NMT makes translations faster and more fluent, but it can still stumble on tricky phrases."}
{"Major": "Artificial Intelligence", "Term": "NP-hardness", "Explanation": "- Basic idea (one sentence): NP-hard means the problem is as hard as the toughest problems we can verify quickly, and there’s no known fast way to solve it in all cases.\n\n- Real-world example (1–2 sentences): Analogy: planning the shortest road trip that visits many cities and returns home. Checking a given route is easy, but testing every possible route to find the best one becomes impossibly slow as the number of cities grows.\n\n- Why it matters (quick takeaway): For NP-hard problems, we usually rely on good-enough methods or solve only special cases where fast, exact solutions are possible, because a general fast solver isn’t known."}
{"Major": "Artificial Intelligence", "Term": "true quantified Boolean formula", "Explanation": "- Basic idea: A true quantified Boolean formula is a logical statement about true/false variables that uses a specified order of quantifiers like “for all” and “there exists,” and it is true if the right sequence of choices makes the whole statement come out true.\n\n- Real-world example: Think of a cooperative game where the opponent picks a switch layout (for all possibilities), and you then choose settings to keep a machine running (there exists). The formula is true if, no matter what layout they pick, you can always pick a safe setting.\n\n- Why it matters: It helps us understand how hard it is to reason with nested choices and why some problems are very challenging for computers to solve; it’s a core idea in logic and AI planning."}
{"Major": "Artificial Intelligence", "Term": "algorithmic probability", "Explanation": "- Basic idea (one sentence): Algorithmic probability says that a given data output is more likely to come from short, simple rules than from long, complicated ones.\n\n- Analogy and quick example (1–2 sentences): Analogy: think of a recipe book where simple, short recipes are far more common than long, exotic ones; a simple repeating rule is a likely explanation for a pattern. Real-world example: for something like 1010101010, a simple \"repeat 10\" rule makes it plausible, whereas a long, tangled instruction set would be far less probable.\n\n- Takeaway (quick takeaway): It helps explain why simple patterns pop up in data and why we often prefer simpler models in AI."}
{"Major": "Artificial Intelligence", "Term": "behavior informatics (BI)", "Explanation": "- Basic idea (one sentence): Behavior informatics (BI) studies how people and systems behave and uses that data to make technology smarter and more helpful—like a coach who adapts training to what you actually do.\n\n- Real-world example (1–2 sentences): For example, a fitness app tracks your steps, sleep, and how often you open it, then adjusts workouts and reminders to fit your real daily routine. This makes it easier to stay motivated because the app fits your life, not the other way around.\n\n- Why it matters (quick takeaway): It helps technology fit real life, making tools more useful and less annoying. Takeaway: BI designs systems that adapt to how people actually behave."}
{"Major": "Artificial Intelligence", "Term": "big data", "Explanation": "- Basic idea: Big data is about collecting and analyzing extremely large and complex sets of information that old tools can’t handle, to find patterns and make better decisions.\n\n- Real-world example: A streaming service tracks billions of viewing events to recommend shows. A retailer analyzes years of sales data to predict demand.\n\n- Why it matters (quick takeaway): It helps us make smarter, faster decisions—from personalized recommendations to better public services. Takeaway: more data can unlock powerful insights if you use the right tools and keep data quality in mind."}
{"Major": "Artificial Intelligence", "Term": "convolutional neural network", "Explanation": "- Basic idea: A convolutional neural network (CNN) is a type of AI that learns to recognize patterns in images by sliding small filters across the picture and combining what they detect to identify objects.\n\n- Real-world example: It helps your phone automatically tag people in photos, and it lets self-driving cars spot stop signs and pedestrians in real time.\n\n- Why it matters (quick takeaway): CNNs let computers learn from lots of pictures to handle visual tasks more quickly and accurately, making modern image-based apps and technologies possible. Takeaway: they’re the core tech behind much of today’s computer vision."}
{"Major": "Artificial Intelligence", "Term": "Darkforest", "Explanation": "- Basic idea in one sentence: Dark Forest in AI is the idea that you might stay quiet about your capabilities and plans, like playing hide-and-seek, because revealing them could invite attack or copying.\n\n- Real-world example (1–2 sentences): A company developing a powerful AI model may keep details of its architecture and training data under wraps to avoid competitors exploiting or mimicking it; researchers may also hesitate to publish sensitive vulnerabilities until fixes are ready.\n\n- Why it matters (quick takeaway): Takeaway: openness helps progress, but in AI safety and security, a bit of restraint can prevent clever misuse and risky competition; balance openness with protection."}
